- or via an admin interface in the CMS.

## Features

* Quick-entry invitation form (By default only first name and email fields are required to invite someone)
* Sends email invitations to recipient
* Supports optional user group assignment (See below for how to enforce this group selection) 
* Invitation expiry can be set via configuration.
* Default SilverStripe member validation is applied.
*  Create and send invites from CMS admin interface

### Force required user group assignment
Place the following in your mysite/_config/config.yml
```yml
Dynamic\SilverStripe\UserInvitations\Model\UserInvitation:
    force_require_group: true
```

### Template override
To update the base template use `updateMainTemplates`. It defaults to `Page`.

```php
/**
 * @param array $mainTemplates
 */
public function updateMainTemplates(&$mainTemplates)
{
    array_unshift($mainTemplates, 'InvitationPage');
}
```

### Redirect after successful user creation

You can set a custom 'BackURL', that the user will be redirected  to, after having completed signup from invitation.
```yml
Dynamic\SilverStripe\UserInvitations\Control\UserController:
    back_url: '/admin/'
```

## Please remember to set an admin_email (used as sender)
This is done in your app/_config/email.yml file
```yml
SilverStripe\Control\Email\Email:
    admin_email: #Default email this site sends emails from
        mail@example.com: 'Admin at example.com'
```
For easy email testing, use: https://mailcatcher.me/
